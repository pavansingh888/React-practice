      index.html - imp - this is the only page which will get loaded. Thats why it is called SPA - Single page application.
      Always we need to bring JS script file to HTML file to run it in the browser -  this is a foundation rule.
      if we haven't loaded JS , how it got loaded?
      If we go to package.json we have:
         "react-scripts": "5.0.1", - This is responsible for inject index.js in the HTML.
